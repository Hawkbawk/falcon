	Use:   "up",
	Short: "Sets up networking, the proxy container, and the daemon",
	Long: `falcon up sets up your local networking to point all requests to *.docker to resolve
to localhost:80. The proxy container (running Traefik) then takes these requests and acts as
a reverse-proxy, determining to which container the request should go to. The falcon daemon runs
in the background and automatically adds the proxy container to any Docker networks that get created.
Note that this command must be run with sudo the first time, or after any calls to 'falcon purge',
in order to install the daemon.`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		networking.Configure()

		// TODO: Finish up the falcon-proxy container so we can pull and start it here.

		if err := proxy.StartProxy(); err != nil {
			log.Fatalln("Unable to start the proxy container. ERROR: ", err)
		}
	},

	rootCmd.AddCommand(upCmd)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// upCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// upCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
